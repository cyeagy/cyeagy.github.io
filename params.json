This grew from loathing how JDBC handles null columns and primitive types. Later expanded to a neat java 8 API around JDBC. Finally finished off with a simple ORM that fits my tastes, which is actually a distaste... for hibernate.\r\n\r\n* [JAX-RS client generator](https://github.com/yeagy/jaxrs-client-gen) creates java source files from annotated resources. I made this to overcome the limitations of proxy based clients, while still having the convenience of not having to write them by hand.",
